# check-it-out

This is the front end of the Check it out Application, it integrates with a backend which is in the vhevk-it-out backend repository.

The main driver behind the project was to crowd source infromation about where to find higly sought after items during the Covid19 lock down. The idea was to get an MVP out there quickly and then refine app.

The hosted version of the application is available here: https://katiep28.github.io/check-it-out/

Technology Used
This project uses the following technology:

ReactJS
JavaScript (ES2015+)

For the backend there is a MYSQL database sitting on AWS. There are 3 tables to support the data.

Future Plans
1. Include API calls to identify users location and shops near by. 
2. Improve the UI
3. Adapt the MVP to check for queues at shops etc.
